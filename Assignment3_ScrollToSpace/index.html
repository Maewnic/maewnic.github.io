    <!-- The core design choice for this project was to create an interactive, educational experience that visualizes the Earth's atmosphere.
      Instead of a static chart, the user gets to engage with the content by scrolling up, which is like ascending through the atmospheric layers.
      This creates an immersive "Scroll to Space" journey. As the user scrolls up, the website reveals objects that associate with each layers of the atmosphere
       (like planes in Troposphere and Auroras in Thermosphere) presenting information within this continuous vertical scroll experience. -->

       <!-- Based on trial and error, the order of the atmosphere has to be written from top to bottom in HTML.
      This is because the scroll event listener calculates the distance from the top of the scroll area,
      so the topmost layer (space) has to be written first in order to be detected first. -->
