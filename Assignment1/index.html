          1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
          with the experience?
        </p>
        <p id="answers">
          The website greeted with a drawing animation, classical music, and
          zoomed out into a whole sketch. The sketch looks messy, but in the
          silhouette of an architecture.

          with?
        </p>
        <p id="answers">
          I spend the most time on the Introduction page. This could be because
          I was introduced to the website and discovered many different
          interactions. From the parallax, the mouse trails on the word
          ‘Sculpting Harmony’, and the video-like scrolling with stretched
          words.

          the experience?
        </p>
        <p id="answers">
          My most common action is just scrolling up and down, watching the
          animation flow with the scroll movement.

          5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?
        </p>
        <p id="answers">
          The design of this website is clean and easy to read, while also being
          artistic and incorporating subtle interactions. The sketches, along
          with classical music, make this website feel fancy and uplifting. I
          think the website communicates well how it is design-driven,
          reflecting the content that explores the design and construction of
          the Walt Disney Concert Hall.

          6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        </p>
        <p id="answers">
          Many of the interactions very well enhance the aesthetic of the
          website. Although some is a little gimmicky, it shows how artistic the
          website is.

          7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
          with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
        </p>
        <p id="answers">
          The animations on the website felt repetitive after scrolling for a
          while, so it’s not the animations that kept the viewer staying on the
          website for long. It seems to be mostly for reading. If the viewer is
          interested in reading, they could stay for quite some time, perhaps up
          to an hour.

          8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?
        </p>
        <p id="answers">
          Due to it being a single-page web. It is intended to be more for
          reading in a linear, following a timeline in order.

          9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
          reference?
        </p>
        <p id="answers">
          This website seems to be referencing something more physical, like an
          exhibition. The viewer has a starting point. Along the journey, there
          are pictures and videos with descriptions labelled, being displayed
          from left to right.

          10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
          act when engaging with your research experience?
        </p>
        <p id="answers">
          A website doesn’t need to be limited to a blog-like format. It could
          be referencing a physical space, but with the flexibility, control,
          and interactions of a website.

          12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and
          what makes that part frustrating?
        </p>
        <p id="answers">
          Sometimes the animation is a little dragging. The text constantly
          switches between far left and far right, making it annoying to change
          the point of focus.

          I am most satisfied with the aesthetic and the animation, particularly
          when elements move in and out, overlap, and videos seamlessly
          transition.
